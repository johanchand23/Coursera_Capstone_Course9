    "The information was craped using the BeautifulSoup library and converted into panda's dataframe. The dataframe was then combined with the information about each District's position (Latitude & Longitude) using https://github.com/johanchand23/Coursera_Capstone_Course9/blob/master/sg.csv. Then, the data was analyzed, cleaned, and processed. As a result, some features have been extracted and used. This project also utilizes the Foursquare API to explore location and trending venues to get the result for areas with popular Japanese restaurant. In addition, Folium was also used to visualize the location and distribution of Districts with most popular Japanese Restaurants all over Singapore."
